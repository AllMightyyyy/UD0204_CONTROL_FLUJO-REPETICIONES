        * Exercise 12

        We have a video game in which our character is positioned on a board (at coordinates x and y) and can move in a certain direction, choosing how many squares to move with each action.

        Request the user to enter a direction ("Up," "Down," "Left," "Right") and the number of squares they want to move.

        Display how the character moves on the screen. For example:

        The character is initially at position x = 4, y = 6.

        User input:

        Down

        3

        The following should be displayed:

        The character moves to position x = 4, y = 5

        The character moves to position x = 4, y = 4

        The character moves to position x = 4, y = 3
